\title{CS 475 Project 2: SIMD Parallelization } 
\author{Robert Adams}
\maketitle


The purpose of this experiment is to test and analyze the speed
gains from using Streaming SIMD Extensions (SSE) and identify
the technologies practical use.


To test SIMD multiplications I created two arrays of size 1000 to 8192000, 
filled them with random floating point numbers, then multiplied each element
in them to create a third array. e.g.
c[1] = a[1] * b[1], c[2] = a[2] * b[2], …, c[n] = a[n] * b[n].
I performed this test 10 times for each array size and averaged the result.


\section{Results}



Since SSE is able to perform four calculations per operation I would have assumed the speedup would be close to 4x, results however, showed an 
average speedup of about 2.5x when using the difference of the times. 
The difference between MFLOPS is much greater, however. I’m not sure why this is.


The large drop in performance at 512000 elements may be due to a memory cap 
imposed on the server I was running the tests on. The server may begin 
to swap values into virtual memory at that point. 


This experiment would not run on on my Macbook. I’m not sure why this is.
